## About
Welcome to `scgUtils`, an R package to help:
* Increase productivity by incorporating and formalising frequently used 
[**functions and charts**](#functions--charts) to run cleaner and more succinct code.
* Maintain brand [**guidelines and styles**](#guidelines--styles) by supplying colours and other 
dataviz standards.

ensure easy debugging for users.*

## Functions & Charts
